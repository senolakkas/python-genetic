Python genetic programming & evolutionary computing modules

Method Decorators:
    - virtual: declare a method as not implemented
    - synchronized: lock a method for one thread
    - comparable: ensure that two argumentss are the same type
    - tuple_crossover: check that two tuples are the same size
    - cached: cache the value returned the first time a method is called
    - memoize: cache the return value of a method by its first argument
    
Data Structures:
    - queue
